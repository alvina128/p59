        <p class="para">My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.

We should learn everything and then choose which path to follow.” Education is neither Eastern nor Western, it is human.” Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani teenage girl, publicly spoke up in favor of female education and was shot in the head by the Taliban, in an apparent attempt to silence her. She survived. The near-fatal attack gave her a global voice that she has been using to continue her fight for female education, on a global scale. Her fight earned her a Nobel Prize when she was 17; this makes her the youngest Nobel Prize winner of all times. In her gripping book I Am Malala, Yousafzai tells a story of bravery, strength, and conviction.  </h1>
